I created this app as a 'midterm' project for my Spring 2013 field study on computing.

It tests my skills programming in Common Lisp and the final function - rig-main - spits out parts of a random d20 system statblock.
It currently requires a keyword argument as there's a bug in the design of gen-cls and other functions responsible for randomly picking a character class.  However, I'm satisfied that the assignment has caused me to grow and demonstrate learning in Common Lisp.
I may revist the program at another time.
